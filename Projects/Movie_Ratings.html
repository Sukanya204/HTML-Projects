            <h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobaara</h3>
                <p>
                    I personally loved this movie because it taught me how to find happiness,
                    even in bleakest situations. When we say Bollywood, the first thing that 
                    comes in our mind is Romance. We die over rubbish and overrated romcoms but 
                    when it comes to an actually sensible movie, we rarely notice.. ZNMD is a 
                    movie that every youngster needs to watch. Its not just a movie where 
                    3 rich people travel lavish locations and come back..The main theme of the 
                    movie is to inspire people to overcome their fear; fear of accepting your 
                    inner voice, fear of what people think when u take a decision of your life, 
                    fear of in fact living your life on your own terms and to do what your heart 
                    says. Through a road trip in Europe, 3 friends rekindle their lost friendship, 
                    regain strength , celebrate life and learn that YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

            <h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
                <p>
                    The film follows the lives of four friends — Kabir (Ranbir Kapoor), 
                    Naina (Deepika Padukone), Aditi (Kalki Koechlin), and Avi 
                    (Aditya Roy Kapur) — as they navigate the highs and lows of life, love, 
                    and friendship. It begins with their college days and spans several years, 
                    showcasing their journey from youthful exuberance to maturity. Kabir, also 
                    known as Bunny, is a free-spirited, adventure-loving guy who dreams of 
                    traveling the world, while Naina is a more reserved and academically 
                    focused girl. Their paths cross in unexpected ways, leading to a 
                    roller-coaster of emotions and realizations.

            <h3>Dil Dhadakne Do</h3>
                <p>
                    The film revolves around the dysfunctional Mehra family, who embark on a 
                    luxurious cruise vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. 
                    As the voyage progresses, hidden conflicts, long-held grudges, and 
                    unspoken truths come to the surface. The family dynamics are explored 
                    through the perspectives of various members: the parents, Kamal and 
                    Neelam Mehra (played by Anil Kapoor and Shefali Shah), their children, 
                    Ayesha and Kabir (Priyanka Chopra and Ranveer Singh), and the family's 
                    domestic staff. The narrative is interspersed with reflections on societal 
                    expectations, personal dreams, and familial obligations.
